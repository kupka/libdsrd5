During this phase of development, I can only accept contributions that have been taken from the SRD 5.1 document under the following constraints:
* You do not claim any additional copyright (i.e the SRD 5.1 copyright claims remain unaltered). That means no OGL content from any source other than the SRD 5.1. 
  And you cannot add or alter a copyright notice anywhere.
* All commits in your pull request must be signed
* At least of of the commits must include a message where you acknowledge and agree to above terms
