During this phase of development, I can only accept contributions that have been taken from the SRD 5.1 document under the following constraints:
* You do not claim any additional copyright (i.e the SRD 5.1 copyright claims remain unaltered). That means no OGL content from any source other than the SRD 5.1. 
  And you cannot add or alter a copyright notice anywhere.
* At least the last commit in a pull request must include a message where you acknowledge and agree to above terms, e.g. "Any content I provided has been taken from the SRD 5.1 and is published under the terms of the Open Game License"
* Ideally, please make this commit through the Github UI, so it is signed/verified as a manual action
