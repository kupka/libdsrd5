# libsrd5

An open source SRD 5.1 library in C#. It aims to implement most of the rules of the [5.1 SRD](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd) 
with zero dependencies other than the .NET framework itself. Very few modern .NET framework features are used, in order to maximize portability.
